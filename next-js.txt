PAGES.

Next.js page is a React Component exported from a (*.js|*.jsx|*.ts|*.tsx) file in the "pages" directory. Each page is associated with a route based on its file name.

Example: File from "pages/about.js" with exported React component will be accessible at "/about" endpoint.

If the page does not need to fetch any external data to be pre-rendered, Next.js generates a single HTML file per page during build time.

Example:
function About() {
  return <div>About</div>
}
export default About
