PAGES.

Next.js page is a React Component exported from a (*.js|*.jsx|*.ts|*.tsx) file in the "pages" directory. Each page is associated with a route based on its file name.

Example: File from "pages/about.js" with exported React component will be accessible at "/about" endpoint.

If the page does not need to fetch any external data to be pre-rendered, Next.js generates a single HTML file per page during build time.

Example:
function About() {
  return <div>About</div>
}
export default About

Pages with Dynamic Routes.
Create a file called pages/posts/[id].js, then it will be accessible at posts/1, posts/2, etc.

hydration - process of converting static markup into dynamic React/nextjs components.

getStaticProps - function that fetches data at build time.

getStaticPaths - function that tells Next.js which pages need to be pre-rendered.

getServerSideProps - function that fetches data on each request.

getInitialProps - function that fetches data on each request.


Two forms of Pre-rendering.

Static Generation - The HTML is generated at build time and will be reused on each request.

Server-side Rendering - The HTML is generated on each request.

Static Generation with and without Data.

Static Generation with Data using getStaticProps.

Your page content depends on external data: Use getStaticProps.

Static Generation without Data using getStaticProps.

Server-side Rendering with Data using getServerSideProps.

Server-side Rendering without Data using getServerSideProps.

getStaticProps and getServerSideProps can only be exported from a page. You canâ€™t export it from non-page files.
